The idea is based upon the necessity that most of the new developers face while programming over their files. Sometimes the situation arises that we have to learn or look for a piece of code or documentations within a file created by a developer or group of developers and we need to obtain those piece of code or documentations instantly and sometimes it happens that two or more people need to work on same files simultaneously. In those situation we have to look over the web to reach to a particular file or code block for our solution which may be time taking and management of those informations is extremely terrible.
> So what if  there is an Text Editor or an IDE for a user that embeds remote files written or currently being edited either in plain text or in some programming language by a developer or programmer? And user can view the categorized hierarchy of currently working developers and their files. User can easily navigate to the files containing the required code block or piece of information. What if there are many developers working over same kind of interest at one place? If it happens, it will be very much helpful for beginners and new developer.
